## Install

**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install Dimmed Theme is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: [Package Control] https://sublime.wbond.net/installation

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select `Dimmed`  when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep Dimmed Theme up to date with the latest version.
